Personal Best was a free mobile app where you competed against your past self in an 8bit Olympic sprint. The core idea was to help people increase their level of physical activity by using their personal activity baseline as a mesaure, rather than aiming for a generic 10,000 steps. 

Personal Best used the onboard sensors on your phone to track your physical activity, or you could connect a FitBit device if you had one. Every time you logged into the app, you could then see how the present day you was doing compared to you from the previous day in an 8-bit computer game race that was inspired by 1980s keyboard smashing athletic games like Daley Thompson's Decathlon and Summer Games on the Commodore 64.

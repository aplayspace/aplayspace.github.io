The influence of the image of others on our sense of self. 

The following research must be relevant. In a series of psychological
experiments with women, Kenrick showed them pictures of female models.26 He
evaluated their mood before and after doing this. After seeing the pictures of the
models, the womenâ€™s mood fell. So how must television affect the mood of the
women who watch it? In 3 hours of viewing TV each day a woman cannot fail to see
a parade of beautiful women. This is unlikely to enhance their mood. And what
about the effect on men? Kenrick also showed the pictures of models to a sample of
men. Before and after this, he evaluated their feelings about their own wives. After
seeing the models, most men felt less good about their wives.27

Personal Best used the onboard sensors on your phone to track your physical activity, or you could connect a FitBit device if you had one. Every time you logged into the app, you could then see how the present day you was doing compared to you from the previous day in an 8-bit computer game race that was inspired by 1980s keyboard smashing athletic games like Daley Thompson's Decathlon and Summer Games on the Commodore 64.

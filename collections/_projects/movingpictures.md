When do brush strokes on a screen take form and become a work of art? How do artists differ in their creation of a painting? Moving Pictures explored the evolution of a piece of art from inception to completion. Visitors could see paintings come alive stroke by stroke and watch as each paintings’ story unfolds.

This project was inspired by Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1956 film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxes8pyHkJc">'Le Mystère Picasso'</a> in which stop-action and time-lapse photography are used to capture Picasso at work.

The idea was to replace the stop-action techniques with touch-based digital devices and then to invite artists to create works that carried the history of every stroke within them. Moving Pictures united technology with art to unravel the process of artistic creation. The finished image is literally unveiled before your eyes.

For many artists, their process is as important as the finished product. The project invited artists to exhibit their process and to open up questions around when this process is complete. The invisioned exhibition aimed to provide unique insights into the story and life of a painting as it unveils itself, and the story of each artist and how they relate to their process of creativity.

The project also intended to enable visitors to create their own digital paintings on their personal devices (i.e., smartphones, iPads or online via the browswer) that would be "hung" in the gallery at a specific time, allow them to paint along stroke-by-stroke with these artists and to take part in-situ in digital painting workshops.

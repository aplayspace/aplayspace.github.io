HealthRhythms is a digital mental health startup that uses objective sensor data and self-reported information to continously assess mental health. 

I co-founded HealthRhythms back in 2014 with Tanzeem Choudhury, Ellen Frank, David Kupfer and Shahid Ali, and served as employee number 1, Product lead and mostly Chief Technology Officer for over 10 years.  

The company was founded on the belief that  there can be no health without mental health. However, reliable measurement of mental health has been a challenge. Patient self-reports are subjective and sporadic, making it difficult to know what is happening between visits. We  created the most advanced mental health platform to integrate mental health intelligence into everyday care. 

Today, Health Rhythms provides continuous assessment of patients' mental health and personalized interventions mostly within the US Health System.

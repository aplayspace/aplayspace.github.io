Deadlung poses a simple question: what difference does playing a health message (in this case 'smoking is bad for your lungs') compared to standard health information communiocation such as government health messages. The visuals for the game were directly inspired by a static image depicting the same. I have not been able to find who created the original image to provide credit. If you know, do let me know.

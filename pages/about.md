# Hi, my name is Mark Matthews (MJM)!

## This site
This site is statically generated and served as HTML. Fundamentally this means there is very little surface area for this site to be hacked or compromised. It does not require a database or backend server to process and render documents. Technically there is still a webserver, but it serves pre-rendered documents generated at build time.
It uses the wonderful Jekyll template, Curate, created by [ZeroStatic](ZeroStatic).
